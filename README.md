## 1. Introduction and motivation of the work
Coding has emerged as the number 1 in-demand skill in recent years. Technology disruption is almost everywhere that significantly alters the way consumers, industries, and businesses operate. After the pandemic of Covid-19, there’s a surge of E-commerce, online news sites, ride-sharing apps, GPS systems, and more which illustrates the importance of technologies and the skill of coding. Coding is one of the most important skills of current for future generations to demystify the digital world. Customer expectations are also evolving as they prefer a speedy buying experience along with personalized product recommendations. Therefore, services provided by programmers are a key success factor of a business. Apart from software and application programmers, business analytics, data analytics also acquire coding skills. The reason for this is because data is becoming more valuable for business decision-making insights and of course resulting in data breaches on the other hand. Thus, the number of cyber security jobs is also increasing. Data is so essential along with technology disruption in the current digital world, we couldn’t deny the importance of coding skills. Therefore, we are interested in looking into insights of new coder surveys to understand more about what the population and generation think. The dataset used was from an open dataset of freeCodeCamp’s surveys. This dataset surveys thousands of people who learn coding for less than 5 years. There are more than 31,000 new coders who participated and responded to this survey. According to observations, 67% of them live outside the United States and 21% are women. They have been coding for an average of 21 months and 17% of them have already landed their first developer job. The median age among the respondents is around 30 years old.
